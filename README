To run the code, prepare case.klist_band and start with:

>path_gqt1.py

which prepares new case.klist_band

Next execute wien2k with the new klist:

>x lapw1 -band

Then run:

>path_gqt2.py

to produce ovelaps M_mmn

Finally, comment out the two lines in path_gqt2.py:

    #Back_Rename_klist()
    #Compute_mmn(nbs=0,nbe=0)

and possibly give arguments of which bands to group to

    Compute_QGT()

and execute path_gqt2.py again.

Finally, plot results with

>pband1.py
