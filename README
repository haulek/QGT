To run the code, prepare case.klist_band and start with:

>path_gqt1.py

which prepares new case.klist_band

Next execute wien2k with the new klist:

>x lapw1 -band
or using eDMFT
>x_dmftp.py lapw1 --band

Then run:

>mpirun -n 6 path_gqt2.py

to produce ovelaps M_mmn

Next you can plot results by

>pband1.py

With this, each band is treated as separate unit.
If you want to combine bands, you can execute:

> path_gqt3.py

Then choose which bands to combine, and than execute

>pband1.py

You can prepare "ppar.dat", which can define the following variables:
"""
Logarithmic = True
maxv = None
Qcolor = [False,True,False]
ymin,ymax = -8.7,8.7
"""
